A 3D graphing calculator for LaTeX math expressions, from scratch. Utilizes my previous C++ evaluator for LaTeX math expressions, InTeX, and integrates it with QtWebEngine to create a HTML/CSS/JS frontend. QtWebChannel is used to connect between the backend C++ and frontend JS. Rendering is done in JS via WebGL2, using GFXFundamentals matrix math and utilities libraries.

No currrent installation, in development
